# Agent Instructions

- Always read and update `TODO.md` whenever work is done that affects the project status.
- Record every automated check you run (and their outcomes) in `TODO.md` under the appropriate section.
- Prefer French for notes and status updates inside documentation files.
- When modifying frontend components under `app/` or `components/`, capture an updated screenshot if the UI changes.
